This appendix explains the values and formulae used in the simulators

Vectors:

Linear motion:
	v = u + (a * t)
	s = (u * t) + (0.5 * a * t * t)

Projectiles:

	For non-sloped, starting from ground projectiles:
		ux = u * Cos(angle)
		uy = u * Sin(angle)
		vx = ux
		vy = uy + (g * t)
		sx = ux * t
		sy = (uy * t) + (0.5 * g * t * t)

	For non-sloped, starting from above ground projectiles:
