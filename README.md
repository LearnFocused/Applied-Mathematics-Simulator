#About
- A simulator for Applied Mathematics.
- Intended to aid students in learning the subject.
- Displays graphically what happens in the physical systems found in Applied Mathematics
- Several example scenarios are given for the covered topics, allowing students to change the parameters and see what happens.
- Uses raphael.js for drawing and jquery-1.11.2.js

#Implemented features:
- Linear motion:
	- Accelerate to a given speed
	- Decelerate to zero
	- One object catches up to another
	- Display real time info
- Projectiles:
	- Normal
	- Starting off ground
	- Incline plane
	- Display real time info
- Relative velocity
	- Simple Vab scenario

#Planned features:
- Connected particles:
	- Particle on surface connected via pulley to falling particles
	- Simple pulley system
	- Sliding wedge system
- Circular motion and Simple harmonic motion:
	- Horizontal circle
	- Vertical circle
	- Pendulum
	- Display speed vs displacement in a graph beside main graphics panel
- Relative velocity:
	- Crossing river
	- Wind appearing to change direction
- Collisions:
	- Moving particle hitting stationary particle
	- Two moving particles hitting each other
