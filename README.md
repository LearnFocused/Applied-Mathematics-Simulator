#About
- A simulator for Applied Mathematics.
- Intended to aid students in learning the subject.
- Displays graphically what happens in the physical systems found in Applied Mathematics
- Several example scenarios are given for the covered topics, allowing students to change the parameters and see what happens.
- Uses raphael.js for drawing and jquery-1.11.2.js

#Implemented features:

	- Accelerate to a given speed
	- Decelerate to zero
	- One object catches up to another
	- Display real time info
- Projectiles:
	- Normal
	- Starting off ground
	- Incline plane
	- Display real time info
- Relative velocity
	- Simple Vab scenario
	- Closest distance at an intersection
